   Once upon a time, there was this evil tech corporate called ColosedSource that used the massive amount of money they had to buy small tech companies on the rise, so that they make sure that they stay the only dominant tech company in the world. 

   For many years, People have aspired to build a tech company that could rival ClosedSource and finally end its monopoly on the market, but that was easier said then done. ClosedSource had a big lead with a lot of data cumulated on its users, but that was also a weakness, as ClosedSource kept cumulating data on its users, they themselves became scared of what that could represent, they had no idea what their data was done with, no idea how their technologie worked and if there weren't any malicious features hidden inside it.

   This era of ClosedSource's reign persisted for a long time until one day, a Hero emerged with a brilliant idea down in his old garage in Bouse9loul, you see for a long time people tried to fight ClosedSource individually forming startups that couldn't last long because of the dominance of ClosedSource, those startups either ended up bankrupt or bought by this evil corporation, but what if you could make something that can't either be bankrupt or bought, something free from ownership that could finally break the circle, this is when our hero who 
goes by the name of Lius Pingun ak on the internet as BirdThatCannotFly bagan his work. Since the ClosedCorp's biggest product was a web browser that the entire world used, he also made a browser. As he was working on it, he decided to call his browser WaterPuinguin in reference to his allies, but how could he make a browser that could rival one that has been so in some many years of development, well this is when the brilliant idea of Lius comes into play, once he had a fonctioning 1.0 version of his browser, he uploaded it to his quite famous tech forum called Lius Tech Tips, this forum was hosted in his own Bouse9loul garage to avoid censorship from ClosedSource and had gained quite a traction among tech enthusiasts, but he didn't just upload an executable, HE UPLOADED THE WHOLE CODE. His message was clear; I did my part, now it's time to do yours. The thread he made is still known to this day as the most visited web page on the planet, its name was OPERATION OPENSOURCE.....
