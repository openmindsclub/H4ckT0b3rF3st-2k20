# Omelette

## Ingredients
2 eggs
A pinch of salt
A pinch of pepper
Chosen filling ingredients (cheese, onions, pepper... etc)

## Cooking Time: 4min

## How to prepare
1. Whisk the eggs, salt and pepper in a bowl.
2. Spray a non-stick skillet with some cooking spray. Cook over medium heat. Pour in the egg mixture. As the eggs set around the edge of the skillet use a spatula to gently push the cooked portions toward the centre of the skillet. Tilt and rotate the skillet to allow the uncooked egg to flow into empty spaces.
3. When eggs are almost set on the surface but still look moist, cover half of the omelette with filling. Slip the spatula under the unfilled side and fold it over onto the filled half.
4. Cook for a minute, then slide the omelette onto the plate.
