# Twitter Automation using Selenium
In this project, we are going to automate some twitter features using Selenium and Python.
We will be automating the process of **logging in to twitter and posting a tweet 🐦**
---
### Prerequisites

This workshop is **ideal for anyone** with any level of programming experience.

> requires knowledge of Python basics like: variables, packages, functions.



#### Setup

-  Mozilla browser
-  Installing Python and pip
##### What is pip?
- For Windows users:
  - Open cmd ( command prompt ) and type **_pip -V_**. If a version shows up in the terminal that means pip is working fine!
- For Linux and Mac users:
  - Open your terminal and type **_pip3 -V_** ( you use pip3 instead of pip ).
##### Installing Selenium

We will first install Selenium via pip ( or pip3 if you are on a Mac or a Linux ).

-  Windows users:
  	- Open CMD (command prompt) and type **pip install selenium** & Enter.
-  Mac and Linux users: 
  	- Open your terminal and type <b>pip3 install selenium</b>  & Enter.
##### Installing webdriver-manager

We need to install webdriver-manager via pip ( or pip3 if you are on a Mac or a Linux ) to proceed further.  
- Why using webdriver manager?
	- in order to automate our browser we need something known as a driver, **_a driver is used by Selenium to automate the browser of your choice._**

## RUN
Okay! now after installing requirements, download automation.py & change **email and password** so the program can run properly so you can automate your tweeting.
- Execute automation.py
- In every step, the code is well documentated.
