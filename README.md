  Hopefully this event will be the first step in your long journey of contributing to free Open-Source projects!<br/><br/>
  By hosting Hacktoberfest 2020, OpenMinds Club strives to encourage everyone in contributing to free Open-Source projects as it has been, and will always remain our philosophy and fundamental goal.<br/> This repository is open to anyone and everyone who seeks to contribute in any project they've liked or discovered. As for the beginners, you are welcome to join our Hacktoberfest as well! Make sure you learn more about [open source](https://github.com/open-source).<br/><br/>
  There is no contribution that is either too small or insignificant. However, every pull request has to, of course, follow some guidelines mentioned [here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality-standards). All of OpenMinds Club welcomes you among our family, whether to attend our FOSS Talk, Git/Github Workhop, or to complete the Openfest challenges.<br/><br/>
